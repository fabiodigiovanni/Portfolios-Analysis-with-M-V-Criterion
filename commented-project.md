In this project I reproduced the Mean-Variance Criterion used by the analysts.

Mean-Variance analysis is the process of weighing risk, expressed as variance, against expected return.
Investors use mean-variance analysis to make investment decisions. They weigh how much risk they are willing to take on in exchange for different levels of reward.
Mean-Variance analysis allows investors to find the biggest reward at a given level of risk or the least risk at a given level of return.

The program will generate all combinations by taking the desired assets and creating portfolios of the desired size.
